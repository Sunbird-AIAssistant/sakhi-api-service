One day the seed decided to settle down and grow. All the other seeds shouted as they went spinning by, “It can’t be done, No, you can’t do that.” “Yes, I can.” said the seed “Just watch me”. The seed took no notice of what all the other seeds said and it planted itself firmly in one spot. It opened itself and sent up a little shoot, then sent down a little root. Still, the wind blew and sand swirled around. Soon the shoot grew above the surface of the sand. It was green and little spikes at the top. All the other seeds shouted as they went spinning by,” It can’t be done, you’ll not survive, you will never grow.” “Yes, I can.” said the seed “Just watch me.” And the shoot grew taller and taller until it grew into a tree. It stood majestic against the bright yellow sand and the brilliant blue sky. All the seeds were amazed and surprised. Years went by and the tree just grew bigger and stronger and started dropping seeds to the ground. Pretty soon those new seeds opened up and sent little shoots up to the sky and little roots down into the sand. It wasn’t long before there were several little trees growing around the big trees."],
